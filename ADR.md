Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Retail Mobile App 

Native, Web, or Hybrid App 
Decision: Native App 
Rationale: Given the requirements, including offline mode and push notifications, a native app is the ideal choice. Native apps offer better performance, offline support, and seamless integration with device-specific features like push notifications. Additionally, a native app will provide a more personalized user experience, ensuring optimal usability and customer engagement. 

UI Framework

Decision: React Native 
Rationale: React Native enables the development of native-like apps using JavaScript and React. It supports both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring consistency in user experience. It's also known for its vast component library and community support, which will facilitate faster development and maintenance. 

Backend Language 

Decision: Node.js 
Rationale: Node.js is chosen for its scalability, performance, and the large npm ecosystem. Given the app's potential rapid user growth and the need to handle a large number of simultaneous connections, Node.js is capable of managing increased loads efficiently. 

Permissions 

Decision: Minimal Permissions 
Rationale: The app will request only essential permissions to enhance user privacy and trust. Permissions will include internet access for syncing data and sending notifications, and storage access for offline mode. The principle of least privilege will be followed. 

Data Storage 

Decision: Local SQLite database and AWS S3 for images 
Rationale: SQLite will be used for local data storage to support offline mode, ensuring users can access their data without an internet connection. AWS S3 will store product images, with optimization techniques like caching and compression to enhance load times and performance. 

Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks 

Decision: Firebase for push notifications, Stripe for payments, and Google Analytics for user behavior tracking 
Rationale: Firebase offers a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution for sending push notifications. Stripe is chosen for its security, ease of integration, and widespread acceptance for payments. Google Analytics will provide detailed insights into user behavior, helping improve app performance and user experience. Localization Decision: i18n Rationale: i18n (internationalization) will be implemented to support multiple languages and cultural preferences, ensuring the app is adaptable and accessible to a global audience.
